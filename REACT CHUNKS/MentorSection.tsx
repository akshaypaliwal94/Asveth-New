              <p>
                Asveth started where most of his clients are now — <strong>skinny, insecure, putting in effort with nothing to show for it.</strong> At 18, after four years of trial and error with no coach, no direction, and only YouTube for guidance, he figured out that results don't come from more effort. They come from the right diagnosis.
              </p>
              <p>
                He's since completed <strong>two Stanford online courses in nutrition &amp; genetics and exercise methodology</strong>, competed at national level powerlifting — and won gold — and built a coaching practice of 65+ active clients across India and the Indian diaspora in Singapore, France, Dubai, and the UK.
              </p>
              <p>
                What makes him different isn't the credentials. It's the framework: <strong>no plan gets built until the body is understood.</strong> Blood markers first. Injury history first. Eating patterns first. Then — and only then — the programme.
              </p>
              <p>
                That's the Diagnostic-First Method. And it's why his clients get results that generic coaching couldn't deliver in years.
